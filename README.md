# ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة

This repository contains Python code for assisting **people with special needs**. The aim of this project is to provide accessible and helpful tools for individuals facing various challenges, including physical disabilities.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: The project utilizes speech recognition to facilitate hands-free interaction, making it easier for users with mobility issues to operate the software.
- **Obstacle Detection**: The code likely includes functionality to detect obstacles (such as walls) in front of the user. This is particularly helpful for visually impaired individuals.
- **Text-to-Speech**: By using libraries like `pyttsx3`, the program can convert text to speech, offering audible feedback for visually impaired users.
- **Braille Reading** (Future Development): There is an interest in adding Braille reading capabilities to further support blind or low-vision users.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the project:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
pip install opencv-python
pip install speechrecognition
```

Other packages that might be needed based on project functionalities:
- **Tkinter**: For GUI interface
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and obstacle detection
- **SpeechRecognition**: For capturing and interpreting voice commands
- **scikit-image**: For image processing and comparison
